# 📚 Habit Tracker - Product Requirements Documentation

*Consolidated and optimized PRD organization (January 2025)*

## 📋 **Document Structure Overview**

This directory contains the consolidated product requirements for the Habit Tracker application, organized to separate product vision from technical implementation details.

### 🎯 **Core Product Requirements**

| Document | Purpose | Size | Status |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| **[CORE_PRODUCT_PRD.md](./CORE_PRODUCT_PRD.md)** | Unified product vision & requirements | ~15KB | ✅ Active |
| **[MOBILE_DEPLOYMENT_PRD.md](./MOBILE_APP_DEPLOYMENT_PRD.md)** | Mobile-specific product needs | ~12KB | ✅ Active |

### 🛠️ **Technical Specifications**

| Document | Purpose | Size | Status |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| **[UNIFIED_TAGGING_SYSTEM.md](./UNIFIED_TAGGING_SYSTEM.md)** | Consolidated tagging specification | ~8KB | ✅ Active |
| **[technical-specs/](./technical-specs/)** | Implementation details | Various | ✅ Active |

### 📚 **Migration Notes**

The original documents (`HABIT_CREATION_PRD.md` and `TAGGING_SYSTEM_PRD.md`) have been successfully consolidated into the new structure with zero content loss. All requirements, technical specifications, and design details have been preserved and reorganized for better clarity and maintainability.
